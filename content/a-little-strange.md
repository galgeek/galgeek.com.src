This week&mdash;mostly 
[this](https://wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen/2014/DecemberMarch/#Mozilla), 
but also a remarkably pleasant interview [here](http://urbanairship.com/), 
and snovember itself&mdash;is reminding me of this wonderful passage I noted 
in James Gleick’s wondrous book 
[*The Information: A History, a Theory, 
a Flood*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Information:_A_History,_a_Theory,_a_Flood)...

> ‘“Now through the very universality of its structures, starting with the [genetic] code, the biosphere looks like the product of a unique event.... The universe was not pregnant with life, nor the biosphere with man. Our number came up in the Monte Carlo game. Is it any wonder if, like a person who has just made a million at the casino, we feel a little strange and a little unreal?”’ 

Jacques Monod, Nobel laureate, 1970
