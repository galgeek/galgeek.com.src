Title: Happy Year of the Wood Ewe!

Category: OP internship

It is the first full day of the [lunar new year](http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2015/02/19/387203812/whatever-floats-your-goat-asian-languages-interpret-lunar-year-animal-differentl?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=morningedition) here on the left coast of America. In some places, it’s considered the year of the goat. Tibetans, I read, are celebrating the new year of the female wood sheep. I live with Buddhists of a Tibetan school, and I’ve knitted so far only with sheep’s wool, never with cashmere, I love sheep’s milk cheeses, and then I’m fond of [polite word play](https://medium.com/message/how-to-be-polite-9bf1e69e888c), so I say that 2015 is the year of the Wood Ewe. I think it will be a good year for all of us soon to finish an [Outreach Program](https://gnome.org/opw/) internship!

I’ve continued to work on the [Firefox UI tests](https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-ui-tests), and I’ve been very fortunate the past couple of weeks to have had generous and patient help from the [A-Team’s](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools) David Burns, Andrew Halberstadt, and Chris Manchester. I’ve landed [my first, teeny-tiny, patch](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/ae54f91e4b10) on the mozilla-central repository. [I learned a lot updating a test conversion that Chris started](https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-ui-tests/pull/91) and helped, and helped, me finish. I learned still more today working on [two](https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-ui-tests/pull/95) [more](https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-ui-tests/pull/96) tests. It’s hard to imagine a better group to work with!

I’m very curious to see what tomorrow brings. And I wish everyone, not just a happy year of the Wood Ewe, but especially the next few nights, a clear view to the west at sunset, to see [Venus and Mars near conjunction and very near the very new crescent moon](http://earthsky.org/tonight/moon-venus-and-mars-bunch-up-at-nightfall-february-20).
