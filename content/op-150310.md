Title: Early Spring
Date: 2015-03-10
Category: OP internship

Spring has arrived early here in Portland, and so, it seems, has the official end of my [Outreach Program](https://gnome.org/opw/) internship, while I still have at least this blog post to write, and one more [Firefox UI test](https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-ui-tests) conversion to finish up, and maybe a library method to polish off for that test, and then there’s at least one more test to convert that’s very like this one... so I hope to be forgiven for saving thank yous and farewells till next time. I will note here and now that [a patch with my name on it](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/efa7c6cf88fc) has landed in the latest version of Firefox itself, and I thank Chris and David for all their help with that!

Maybe you’d like to do something similar this summer? The latest round of [Outreachy](https://www.gnome.org/outreachy/) (new name) internships have been announced. Your initial contribution and application are due the 24th of this month. I promise, there’s no group you’ll enjoy working with more than Mozilla’s [A-Team](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools). Be sure to check out [their project](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Outreachy/2015/May_to_August#Integrate_the_ability_to_arbitrarily_retrigger_jobs_into_functional_tools_and_production_quality_code).

I’m off to the [PyLadies](http://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-PDX/) Resume Workshop this evening, and to the [RailsBridge Workshop](https://www.bridgetroll.org/events/149) Saturday, perhaps with a first voyage on our new-old [Cascade 9 dinghy](http://www.cascadeyachtworks.com/models/dinghy/photo-gallery.htm) and plenty of [daffodil admiration](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174790) in between, to celebrate the early spring!
