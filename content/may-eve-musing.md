Hooray for Open Source Bridge! It was at last year’s conference that I learned
of the upcoming [Ascend Project](http://ascendproject.org/participants/portland/index.html), and I’ve just learned the talk I’d proposed this year
with my fellow Ascenders Jessica Canepa and Adam Okoye has been accepted.

I may be on a bit of a web development pilgrimage... I really enjoyed Railsbridge, though I think that was back in March, and last week I used more than enough parentheses at ClojureBridge, and this week, I finished the Django Girls tutorial, and then began to work on Flask. I still have a Drupal site, a WordPress site, and this, my own Pelican site, to maintain. Is that enough for a pilgrimage?

And now, to prepare the [Beltane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beltane) festivities!
