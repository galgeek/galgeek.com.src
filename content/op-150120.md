Title: Turn! Turn! Turn!

Updates to [testdaybot](https://github.com/mozilla/testdaybot) are nearly ready for a maiden run! And so I turn my attention to [firefox-ui-tests](https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-ui-tests). This is a very different project, one that several people from Mozilla’s [A-Team](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools) are actively working on, and still early in its development. I’m beginning by looking at what preferences these tests might want to set and where. This is a bigger question than I’d have guessed... so far I’ve looked [here](http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-beta/source/testing/mozbase/mozprofile/mozprofile/profile.py#330), [here](https://github.com/mozilla/mozmill/blob/master/mozmill/mozmill/__init__.py#L138), and [here](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/javascript/firefox-driver/webdriver.json), and that’s only the code, not any of the documentation. And I learned a new command line tool today, [`comm`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14473090/find-lines-from-a-file-which-are-not-present-in-another-file).

I intend, too, to turn to blogging more often as I work on this project, perhaps most importantly, to keep a better record of my questions. Here’s my next: what prefs are already being set by the [Marionette client](http://marionette-client.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)?
