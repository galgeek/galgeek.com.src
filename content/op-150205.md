Title: good intentions and better documentation

Sixteen days ago I wrote that I intended to blog more often... I think I even remembered that through much of last week. Then I dove into the [Firefox Puppeteer](https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-ui-tests/tree/master/firefox_puppeteer) libraries, and the [tests for those libraries](https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-ui-tests/tree/master/firefox_puppeteer/tests), and now it’s already Friday, February 6th,&nbsp;in most of the world.

What I also did just yesterday that may be of somewhat broader interest is to set up [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) [multi-OS continuous integration](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/multi-os/) (Linux and Mac OS&nbsp;X) for [firefox-ui-tests](https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-ui-tests). This isn’t necessarily as challenging as some of the Travis documentation may lead you to believe. Firefox UI tests are written in Python. One of the configurations that [Travis does not currently support](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/2320) on Mac OS&nbsp;X is Python. 

The Travis Mac hosts do, however, have the usual OS&nbsp;X&nbsp;10.9.5 Python&nbsp;2.7 installation. If your Python test suite runs against Python&nbsp;2.7, like the firefox-ui-tests do, you can probably use the Travis multi-os set up without much fuss. First, you must request multi-os from [Travis support](mailto:support@travis-ci.com). Nothing will change until you update your .travis.yml, to [something like this](https://github.com/galgeek/firefox-ui-tests/blob/travis-osx/.travis.yml). You set your language to C, and you set compiler to either gcc *or* clang, so that you get only one compiler build set. You also set os to both "linux" and "osx." Then, since you probably want to do a few things differently on Linux versus OS&nbsp;, you write [a bash script](https://github.com/galgeek/firefox-ui-tests/blob/travis-osx/.travis/install.sh) with an `if [ "$TRAVIS_OS_NAME" == "osx" ]` block or two, and maybe another bash script for another part of the build process, and you’re done.

*If instead you’re developing a Python library that you want to test against multiple Python versions on OS&nbsp;X, you’ll want to have a [look here](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography).*

And if instead of all this, you’re more interested in a tiny home, and probably most people are, well, let me recommend [Lloyd Kahn’s blog](http://lloydkahn-ongoing.blogspot.com/) and books, [*Tiny Homes*](http://www.shelterpub.com/_tiny_homes/tiny_homes_book.html) and [*Tiny Homes on the Move*](http://www.shelterpub.com/_thom/tinyhomesonthemovebook.html)
